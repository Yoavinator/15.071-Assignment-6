        "# Problem Context\n",
        "Waste management refers to the collection, transportation, and processing/disposal of household and light industrial trash and related materials.  In most countries, waste management is a logistics function that is typically managed at a regional level -- at the county/province/prefecture/canton level in most countries.  Sustainable solutions to waste managemnt problems are even more important as the cost of sanitary landfills has increased considerably.  The decisions of where to construct sanitary landfills (and possible waste compaction transfer stations)  -- in order to minimize total system costs -- is now tackled using modern optimization modeling in conjunction with other business analytics modeling tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "KSA (Kendall Square Analytics) is an analytics-based consulting firm that has recently expanded its practice scope to include serving government and government-related organizations using business analytics for the delivery of a wide variety of public services, including waste management.  \n",
        "\n",
        "KSA has recently been retained by Ogemaw County to assist them in the development of a cost- and environmentally-efficient plan for the siting of sanitary landfills (and possibly waste compaction stations) and associated transportation and logistics decision planning.  As shown in Figure 1, Ogemaw County is a \"square\" region 100 miles by 100 miles, with 50 town/city centers shown in the blue discs in the figure (with the size of each disc being proportional to the population of the town/city center).  Also shown in the figure in green are the candidate locations of 15 candidate sanitary landfill locations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Up until last year, Ogemaw County focused its waste collection efforts on acquiring and operating waste transportation trucks and efficiently designing collection routes. Waste was collected, transported, and disposed of in open-air waste dumps which burned the waste. Burning waste is one of the environmentally worst ways to dispose of waste, and so Ogemaw County was mandated by court order to construct sanitary landfills for waste disposal. They chose three sites for the construction of landfills as shown in Figure 2, whose names are Lake Lorraine,  Muhlenberg Park, and Renfrow. (In the figure the gray lines show the transportation flows of waste tonnage from the town/city centers to the three landfill sites.) The total transportation cost of the plan in Figure 2 is estimated to be **\\$560,000 per week** based on the current weekly waste produced in each town/city center and using the unit waste transportation cost of **\\$1.03 per ton per mile**."

        "# Task 2: Including the possibility of building transfer stations in the waste management plan\n",
        "\n",
        "The KSA engagement lead has proposed that the team study the possibility of building waste compaction transfer stations as part of the overall capital and logistics plan. Waste compaction essentially reduces the volume of waste, making it proportionally less expensive to transport. As mentioned earlier, the transportation cost of waste is estimated to be \\$1.03 per mile per ton. However, compacted waste is estimated to cost \\$0.40 per mile per ton to transport, as shown in Figure 4 below. The capital outlay for a compaction transfer station is quite large, but this cost is offset by the lower transportation cost (and presumably a lower environmental impact) of such transportation. KSA estimates that the weekly cost of servicing a bond on one newly-constructed transfer station is $6,500 per week. Each transfer station can treat up to 2,000 tons of waste per week.\n",
